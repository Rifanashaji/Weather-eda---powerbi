# Weather-eda--powerbi
üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Analysis ‚Äì Dashboard & EDA
Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather conditions across various Australian cities. Using a combination of Python and Power BI, the dataset is explored to understand key patterns in rainfall, temperature, wind, and humidity.

 Project Description

 
The aim of this project is to extract meaningful insights from weather data to support weather forecasting or general climate pattern understanding. The Power BI dashboard is designed to be interactive and visually appealing, allowing users to filter data and identify relationships between different weather features such as temperature at 3 PM, wind gust direction, and rain status.

The Python notebook supports the initial data exploration and cleaning process to prepare the data for visualization.

 Key Features of the Dashboard

 
 Rain Pattern Analysis: Explore how RainToday and RainTomorrow vary by location.

Temperature Visualization: Sum of Temp3pm and comparison with MaxTemp.

Humidity Curve: Sum of Humidity3pm across temperature ranges.

Wind Insights:

Average WindGustSpeed by location.

Directional pie chart based on RainToday.

Location-Based Trends: Easily compare different cities.

Interactive Filters: Rain status slicers for Today and Tomorrow.



 Tools Used

 
Power BI ‚Äì For creating the interactive dashboard.

Python (Jupyter Notebook) ‚Äì For EDA and data preparation.

Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn ‚Äì For data analysis and visualization (in notebook).

Excel/CSV ‚Äì Original data source.


 Conclusion

 
This project successfully demonstrates how combining Python for analysis and Power BI for visualization can lead to meaningful insights from weather data. It provides a clear view of how different weather variables interact, and how they change across time and locations.

By visualizing these insights, decision-makers or weather enthusiasts can better understand weather behavior, especially with respect to rainfall prediction and temperature patterns.
